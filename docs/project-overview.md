## Laboratory Work Structure

Each laboratory work (lab1 through lab8) follows a consistent directory structure:

labN/
├── task/
│   └── README.md          # Assignment description and implementation details
└── report/                # Final report and documentation
```

### Directory Descriptions

- **task/** - Contains the assignment requirements, implementation process, source materials, and working documentation for the laboratory work
  - `README.md` - Main documentation file describing the task, approach, and results

- **report/** - Contains the final formatted report ready for submission
  - This directory should include the completed report in the required format (e.g., PDF, DOCX)
